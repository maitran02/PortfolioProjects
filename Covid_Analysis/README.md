# 1. Data Exploratory 
Run [**load_data_to_sql.ipynb**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid_Analysis/load_data_to_sql.ipynb) before running **covid_exploratory.sql**, this will use pandas module to import csv and store data as DataFrame, then use to_sql() function to write records stored in a DataFrame to a SQL database. 
Otherwise, you could create a new table and import data directly using SQL.

# 2. Data Visualization
Creating Measure using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is sufficiently to visualize data as I did in Power BI.
However, I also used SQL Queries to double check my answer.
