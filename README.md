# PortfolioProjects
Data Analysis Portfolio Projects using `PostgreSQL`, `Python` (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn), and BI tool: `Power BI`.

1. [**Google DA Capstone - Case Study 1 - Divvy Bikes**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Google%20DA%20Capstone%20-%20Case%20Study%201%20-%20Divvy%20Bikes)

    This case study is part of Google Data Analytics Professional offered by Google and available on Coursera. 
    - My certficate from the specialization: [Professional Certificate - Google Data Analytics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o23DyZbGB4QBYkIf_kMwmcrYoszEsiRD/view?usp=drive_link) 
    - [Case study and Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13MHGBREjf5W11GWylNs2XUU8n6ik6UtV?usp=sharing) from Google
    - My analysis using Python: [notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Google%20DA%20Capstone%20-%20Case%20Study%201%20-%20Divvy%20Bikes/notebook.ipynb)
    - Documentation and Report (visualization included): [Report](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Google%20DA%20Capstone%20-%20Case%20Study%201%20-%20Divvy%20Bikes/notebook.ipynb)

2. [**8 Week SQL Challenge**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/8%20Week%20SQL%20Challenge)

    The series is initiated by **Danny Ma** and is available on his website: [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). In this challenge, I answer his set of questions for each distinct case study using PostgreSQL. 
    
    This will test my general knowledge and familiarity with SQL tools, including `JOIN`ing tables, aggregating functions and aggregating by categories (`GROUP BY`), advanced filtering (`WHERE`) with subqueries, the usage of `LIKE` and wildcards, window partitioning (`RANK`, `ROW_NUMBER`, `LEAD`, `LAG`), conditional statements (`CASE`), updating values in a database (`INSERT INTO`, `ALTER COLUMN`), creating views and temporary tables, working with time series data, unnesting strings to arrays and string aggregation, dealing with null values using `COALESCE`, and manipulating text data with functions like `REPLACE`, `TRIM`, `POSITION`, `SUBSTRING`, etc.
    
    I have summarized knowledge of SQL tools I obtained from various online courses (Coursera, Datacamp, Udacity) [here](https://piquant-lantern-b9c.notion.site/SQL-3119540931274eb6976eb748945d1cf5).

3. [**Nashville Data Cleaning**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Nashville_Data_Cleaning)

    This project is conducted under the instruction of [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rO7ztF4NtU&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=3&t=2875s). The purpose of this project is for [Data Wrangling using PostgreSQL](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville_Data_Cleaning/nashville_housing.sql). 

4. [**Covid Analysis**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Covid_Analysis)

    This project is also conducted under the instruction of [Alex The Analyst](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Covid_Analysis). The purpose of this project is for [Data Exploration using PostgreSQL](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid_Analysis/covid_exploratory.sql) and [Data Visualization using Power BI](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid_Analysis/covid.pbix). 

5. [**Movie Industry Correlation Python**](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/MovieIndustry_Correlation_Python)

    This project is also conducted under the instruction of [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPYVYBtUTyE&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f&index=5). The tool used here is [Python to identify correlation](https://github.com/maitran02/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/MovieIndustry_Correlation_Python/movies_correlation.ipynb) between variables in Movie Industry dataset. 


Additionally, I would like to attach Certificates I obtained from Massive open online courses (MOOCs) and competitions I participated: [**Certificates**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PwRUziANnE0MrfnH3m8m3X-ND4TEUg7F?usp=drive_link).
